The purpose of this project is to pull selected data ranges from a CSV file to then store as a class for each subject. 
All trials are stored in the class and multiple variables within those classes for three time instances. Initial Contact, Peak force, and take off are stored for later data analysis and statistics.
Time ranges must be specificed in the Ankle Driver file
